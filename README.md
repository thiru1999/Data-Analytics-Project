## Dashboard type Dashboard by use-case: Exploratory

## Target audience: Management Teams

# Framework

In Health Care Domain Quality Metrics Will depends on Following Domains
- Safety 
- Effectiveness
- TimeLiness
- Patient Centred
- Equality
- Efficiency

  In My Case Study ,I'm going to look into the Effectiveness Domain  using POWER BI .

  LOS (Length Of Stay- total duration in Days Patient stays in Hospital ) and Total Cost are the important Metrics to track the Efectiveness of a Hospital
  Low Los Means Better Efficiency Which Means Hospital can serve Many Patient.
 
  Below are the Factors which can Impact LOS
  - Patient age
  - Health status
  - type of Complication
  - size of hospital 

Lets dive into the Data and Understand it Better with a Meta Data

Our Data Comprised of Patient Who Done Hip Replacement Suregery
https://orthoinfo.aaos.org/en/treatment/total-hip-replacement - > To get some Domain Knowledge about surgery
Short Intro about Surgery ->Patient with Hip Pain and Arthiritis Typically Do this Surgery ,In this Surgery Doctors will replace the Damaged Bone and Cartilage with Prosthetics Components

# Key Performance Indicators and Metrics:
- Total Surgeon Based on Filter Context Applied
- Average LOS days
- Total Hospitals
- Total Discharges
- Highest and Lowest Avg Los Day By Hospital
- Average Cost Per Discharge
- Highest and Lowest Avg Cost Per Discharge

# Measures Used

# Observation

- Northern Dutches Hospital is showing Very Good Efficiency by  having Very Less Avg LOS day (1.4 days) and Highest Discharge (293) with Merely 5 surgeon
- Some Hospitals like Lutheran NYU hospital are Too Costly ,Even though they are having Less LOS(2.6d) they are charging around average $84601 from Patient
- Best Hospital in Region Wise based on Less LOS and Low Average Cost Per Discharge :
    - Alice Hyde Medical Centre in Capital/Adiron
    - St Elizabeth Medical Centre in Central NY
    - Unity Hospital of Rochester in FingerLakes
    - Northern Dutchess Hospital in Hudson Valley
    - South Nassau Community Hospital in  Long Island
    - Erie Country Medical Centre in NewYork City
    - United Health Service Hospital In Southern Tier
 For the Above Hospital Total Discharge Number is Not Considered ,May be Some Hospital Have Less LOS and Low Cost Per Discharge  at the same Time they will have Less Bed to Accommodate Patient.

- Capital/Adiron region is Mangaing Hospital Effieciently with 49 Surgeon ,Average Cost Per Discharge is $14k and Los is 2.39 Days only
